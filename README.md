### Services

Cisco DNA monitoring encompasses several specialized services, each targeting specific aspects of network performance:

1. Overall Health
   * Description: Provides a global view of the health of the enterprise, including network devices and clients. It aggregates data from various aspects of the network, making it the central point for monitoring the entire system's health.


2. Network Health
   * Description: Provides detailed health information for network devices, focusing on the status and performance of network devices.


3. Client Health
   * Description: Provides detailed health information for wired and wireless client devices, focusing on the status and performance of client devices.


4. Network Services
   * Description: Monitors the health of network services like AAA and DHCP, which are critical for network operations.


5. AAA
   * Description: Monitors the AAA network service, crucial for authentication, authorization, and accounting.


6. DHCP
   * Description: Monitors the DHCP network service, essential for IP address management.


### KPIs

Each service utilizes specific KPIs to measure its effectiveness:


1. CPU Pct
   * Description: Monitors the CPU usage percentage of network devices.


2. Memory Usage
   * Description: Tracks the memory usage of network devices.


3. Interface Errors
   * Description: Counts the number of errors on network interfaces.


4. Packet Loss Pct
   * Description: Measures the percentage of packet loss on network devices.


5. Client Connection Time
   * Description: Measures the time taken for clients to connect to the network.


6. Client Throughput
   * Description: Tracks the data throughput for client devices.


7. Client Latency
   * Description: Measures the latency experienced by client devices.


8. Client Error Rate
    * Description: Counts the error rate for client connections.


9. Service Response Time
    * Description: Measures the response time of network services.


10. Service Error Rate
    * Description: Tracks the error rate of network services.


11. Auth Success Rate
    * Description: Measures the success rate of authentication requests.


12. Auth Response Time
    * Description: Tracks the response time for authentication requests.


13. Auth Failure Count
    * Description: Counts the number of failed authentication attempts.


14. Lease Success Rate
    * Description: Measures the success rate of DHCP lease assignments.


15. Lease Response Time
    * Description: Tracks the response time for DHCP lease requests.


16. Lease Failure Count
    * Description: Counts the number of failed DHCP lease attempts.


### Relationships

#### Dependencies:
Services are interconnected; for instance, the Overall Health service depends on Network Health, Client Health, and Network Services to provide a comprehensive view of the network's health.

#### Hierarchical Structure:
Some services form a hierarchy, such as Network Services depending on AAA and DHCP, illustrating a layered approach to performance monitoring where base metrics support broader performance indicators.
